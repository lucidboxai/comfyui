## Modification Notice

**This is a modified version of the original software.**

This repository is a fork of [ai-dock/comfyui](https://github.com/ai-dock/comfyui), authored by
Robert Ballantyne, trading as AI-Dock. It has been modified by lucidboxai and is **not** the
original, unmodified work. Please raise any issue arising from these changes here rather than
with the upstream project.

This notice is provided in accordance with clause 5 of [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

In summary, the modifications cover:

- Modernization to Python 3.12 and a current PyTorch / ComfyUI pairing
- The image now builds `FROM` the modified python image published by this fork rather than the
  original upstream image
- Dependency policy: ComfyUI and ComfyUI-Manager pinned to commit SHAs, and runtime
  auto-update defaulted off, so a rebuild is reproducible
- Updated model directory layout and persistence symlinks for the current ComfyUI tree
- The bundled service portal issues the container's opaque web token as its session cookie
  rather than a value derived from the configured password — see the `PORT-*` commits
- CI workflow changes specific to this fork's container registry and build targets — see the
  `INFRA-*` commits

The complete corresponding source for every modification is public in this repository's git
history. To review the full diff against the original:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ai-dock/comfyui.git
git fetch upstream
git log --patch upstream/main..main
```

All original copyright, licence and attribution notices are preserved unaltered below and in
[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

## Notice:

I have chosen to apply a custom license to this software for the following reasons:

- **Uniqueness of Containers:** Common open-source licenses may not adequately address the nuances of software distributed within containers. My custom license ensures clarity regarding the separation of my code from bundled software, thereby respecting the rights of other authors.

- **Preservation of Source Code Integrity:** I am committed to maintaining the integrity of the source code while adhering to the spirit of open-source software. My custom license helps ensure transparency and accountability in my development practices.

- **Funding and Control of Distribution:** Some of the funding for this project comes from maintaining control of distribution. This funding model wouldn't be possible without limiting distribution in certain ways, ultimately supporting the project's mission.

- **Empowering Access:** Supported by controlled distribution, the mission of this project is to empower users with access to valuable tools and resources in the cloud, enabling them to utilize software that may otherwise require hardware resources beyond their reach.

I welcome sponsorship from commercial entities utilizing this software, although it is not mandatory. Your support helps sustain the ongoing development and improvement of this project.
